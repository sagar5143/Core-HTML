    <h1>Web Design</h1>

    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design, user interface design (UI design), authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software, user experience design (UX design), and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</p>
